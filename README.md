Noise-pollution-monitoring-system (Read me)

Arduino code for a noise pollution monitoring system is quite extensive and would typically require specific hardware components and sensors tailored to the project. However, I can provide a basic outline of the code structure and suggest the components may need. We need a sound sensor or microphone to measure noise levels and possibly an LCD or other display to show the readings. i am attached the arduino code for this project. 

This code is a basic example and doesn't include advanced features like data logging or connectivity for remote monitoring. Depending on my project requirements, may need to expand upon this code to store and analyze noise data or transmit it to a server for monitoring and analysis.

Additionally, make sure to install the required libraries for the LCD display if we choose to use one, and adjust the pin numbers and sensor calibration as needed for our specific components.
